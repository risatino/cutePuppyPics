  <h2>What Can Cats Eat?</h2>
  <p>Do you have a cat? A monkey? A lamb? A dog? Pets are treated as family in my household. I have a cat that loves to eat, but I try my best to feed him healthy food. He was born on October 15th, 2007. He is ten and a half years old, and is pretty healthy despite the fact that he was the runt of his litter. His human mom is <a href="http://www.risatino.com">Risa Tino</a>. His original parents were Shelby and Ozzy who are immigrants from St. Joseph, Illinois.</p>
